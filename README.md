## Description

Welcome to Steppin' Style! This project showcases a modern, responsive website designed for an online shoe store, desktop and mobile. 
It highlights my front-end development skills, including design, user interface, and user experience optimization.

## Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and JavaScript. Also, I used multiple free programs online for my "products" manipulation.
